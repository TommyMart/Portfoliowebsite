You can visit my **[Portfolio Website](https://tommartinportfolio.netlify.app/)** here.

And access the code via the **[Github repo](https://github.com/TommyMart/Tom-Martin-Portfoliowebsite)** here.

The purpose of my portfolio website it to showcase my HTML and CSS learnings thus far, and to add projects to it as I progress as a developer. 
The wesbite uses only vanilla HTML and CSS and utilises images and links to navigate around the site. The website features a projects
and a blog age to display my works and interests, it also has a skills page that features a link to my resume, should potential employers
wish to see.

## Responsive Design

Responsive design was used to improve the viewer experience depending on what screensize they were viewing the website from. CSS flexbox layout was utlised to 
enhance the overall experience by wrapping sections of the page next to each other when the screen size allows. This can be seen in the screenshot example below,
where the skills are aligned next to each other in a row instead of a longer column that would need to be scrolled to view. CSS media screens were also used to change styling, such as font-size, depending on the viewing screen size.
