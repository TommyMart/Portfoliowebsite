# Hi! 

And welcome to Tom Martin's portfolio website's readme page. 

You can visit my **[Portfolio Website](https://tommartinportfolio.netlify.app/)** here.

And access the code via the **[Github repo](https://github.com/TommyMart/Tom-Martin-Portfoliowebsite)** here.

The purpose of my portfolio website is to communicate and demonstarte my developer and IT professional abilities to prospective employers. Projects will be added to the website as I progress as an aspiring developer to reflect this. The website features a projects and a blog page to display my coding experience, abilities and interests, it also has a skills page and a link to my resume. The aim of the website is to aid in gaining full-time employment at a company who shares similar values. 


## SITEMAP

## Responsive Design

Responsive design was used to improve the viewer experience depending on what screensize they are viewing the website from. CSS flexbox layout was utlised to enhance the overall experience by wrapping sections of the page next to each other when the screen size allows. This can be seen in the screenshot example below,
where the skills are aligned next to each other in a row instead of a longer column that would need to scrolling to view. CSS media screens were also used to change styling, such as font-size, depending on the viewing screen size to asist in legibility.

## Tech Stack
The technologies used to build my portfolio website are HTML and CSS, version control was commited to GitHub, and Netlify is used as the deployment platform. 

## Wireframes 

Wireframes were designed to gain direction before embarking on the website build, this gave me a reference point if ever I should need it.
