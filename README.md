# Portfoliowebsite
# Hi! 

And welcome to Tom Martin's portfolio website readme markdown page. 

You can visit my **[Portfolio Website](https://tommartinportfolio.netlify.app/)** here.

And access the code via the **[Github repo](https://github.com/TommyMart/Tom-Martin-Portfoliowebsite)** here.

The purpose of my portfolio website is to communicate and demonstarte my abilities to prospective employers. Projects will be added will be added as I progress as an aspiring developer. The wesbite uses only vanilla HTML and CSS and utilises images and links to navigate around the site. The website features a projects and a blog page to display my coding experience, abilities and interests, it also has a skills page and a link to my resume. 

## SITEMAP

## Responsive Design

Responsive design was used to improve the viewer experience depending on what screensize they were viewing the website from. CSS flexbox layout was utlised to enhance the overall experience by wrapping sections of the page next to each other when the screen size allows. This can be seen in the screenshot example below,
where the skills are aligned next to each other in a row instead of a longer column that would need to be scrolled to view. CSS media screens were also used to change styling, such as font-size, depending on the viewing screen size.
