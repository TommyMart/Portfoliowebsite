# Portfoliowebsite
# Hi! 

And welcome to Tom Martin's portfolio website's readme page. 

You can visit my Portfolio Website **[here](https://tommartinportfolio.netlify.app/)** .

And access the code via the Github repo **[here](https://github.com/TommyMart/Tom-Martin-Portfoliowebsite)** .

## Purpose

The purpose of my portfolio website is to communicate and demonstarte my developer and IT professional abilities to prospective employers. Projects will be added to the website as I progress as an aspiring developer to reflect this. The website features a projects and a blog page to display my coding experience, abilities and interests, it also has a skills page and a link to my resume should be required. The end goal of the website is to aid in gaining full-stack employment or an internship at a company who shares similar values. 


## SITEMAP 

This sitemap was developed so that I would have an idea of the layout of the website before commencing the build.

## Responsive Design

Responsive design was used to improve the viewer experience depending on what screensize they are viewing the website from. CSS flexbox layout was utlised to enhance the overall experience by wrapping sections of the page next to each other when the screen size allows. This can be seen in the screenshot example below,
where the skills are aligned next to each other in a row instead of a longer column that would need to scrolling to view. CSS media screens were also used to change styling, such as font-size, depending on the viewing screen size to assist in legibility.

## Target Audience

My portfolio website is inteded to showcase my work, skills and personality to potential employers who have technical knowledge of information technology, development, programming languages and development stacks.

## Tech Stack
The technologies used to build my portfolio website are as followes:

- HTML - for the basic structure and content. 
- CSS - for styling, flexbox, media screens and annimations. 
- Markdown - for the writing the READAME.MD file. 
- VS Code - IDE for writing the code. 
- GitHub - for version control.
- Netlify - for the deployment platform. 

## Wesbite Aesthetics

I wanted the website to have a simple, modern, clean and sharp aesthetic. To achieve this, high constrasting black and white was chosen as the two main colours, along with a soft but bright lilac for larger text extra styling, used on the current selected navbar page and when hovering over buttons.

A simple Nunito sans serif font was used to improve legibility and cohesively work with the modern aesthetic of the site. Simple annimations were used to make the wesbite more interesting, though these were purposefully not overdone to keep inline with the chosen aesthetic.

## Wireframes 

Wireframes were designed to gain direction before embarking on the website build, this gave me a geographical reference point if ever I should need it.
